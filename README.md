# Discontinued
I found out Chromium provides the same feature via 'Other Search Engines' Type `youtube.com` in the omnibar and after pressing space it will use the subsequent query. You can set the keyword to a anything like `y`. 

If you want to use DDG bangs with a different default search engine just set the DDG keyword to `d` then you can use ddg bangs pretty easily with `d !yt rick roll` and just add custom ones as your own search engine. 

Right now, there is no planned feature significant enough to motivate the development this extension.

# ddg-bangs
Use DuckDuckGo Bangs on Google or Bing.

## Upcoming Features
- [ ] override ddg bangs with user defined bangs
